If there is Pwave there is a "Sinus" 
Tachy and Brady, inconsistent - 6 sinus syndrome

P wave has 3 distinct patterns? - Wandering Atrial Pacemaker (The impulse can be anywhere not originating from the sinus node)
> The Impulse originated from atrium (AV node) because if the impulse from the sinus, the pwave will look normal

// Calculating heart rate
Divided 300
    Count  Big boxes between 2 Rs and divide the 300 by the number of boxes
Divided 1500
    Count small boxes between 2 Rs and divide the 1500 by the number of small boxes
x10
    Irregular, count in a 6second strip the Rs (How many Rs in the 6second strip?) then multiply by 10


// How to read ECG?
    1. Read Rhythm (Regular, Irreg)
    2. Read Rate (Brady, Tachy, Normal)
    3. Look at waves 

PAC

P waves can't be seen - Atrial Fib


Interpret:
// A fib 
    Ventricular response: Tachy or brady? (ex. Bradycardic ventricular response)
    Absent P waves
    Irregular rhythm


SVT: Supraventricular Tachycardia
    This is an umbrella term
    Not sinus, so there is a problem in the p wave
    Wide QRS? It is a ventricular problem

// Focal Atrial Tachy
    HR 100-250
    Rhythm Regular usually
    P wave is abnormal
    QRS usually normal
Takeaway: P wave abnormal, and tachycardia. P wave is consistent in it's abnormal shape

// Multifocal Atrial Tachy
Takeaway: Tachy version of WAP
    P wave also abnormal, but not consistent on how it looks (may have 3 or more morphologies)

// AV Blocks
    PR Interval 0.2 second
    P wave precedes QRS complex
    Impulse from Atria are consistently delayed
    Atrial and ventricular rhythms are regular

// Sinus Bradycardia

// Sick Sinus Syndrome

// Premature Atrial Contraction
    The R-R got closer


// AV Block
1st degree
    Consistent wide PR interval (start of P until R)

2nd degree type 1
    Wenckebach (other name)
    PR interval prolongs until QRS complex drops, then repeat

2nd degree type 2 - consistent pronlong pr with qrs drop


3rd degree - P waves and QRS will have no connection (Pwave and QRS appears and disappears any time, unrelated to each other's disappearance)


//Junctional Rhythm
        Usually no P wave, if seen the Pwave is abnormally located

    Junctional AV Nodal Rhythm
        Is regular rhythm. Less than 60 bpm (40-60) 
        RR is short

    Junctional Tachycardia
        normal rhythm
        What stands out? The shape of p wave. Either inverted or none
