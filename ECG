If there is Pwave there is a "Sinus" 
Tachy and Brady, inconsistent - 6 sinus syndrome

P wave has 3 distinct patterns? - Wandering Atrial Pacemaker (The impulse can be anywhere not originating from the sinus node)
> The Impulse originated from atrium (AV node) because if the impulse from the sinus, the pwave will look normal

P waves can't be seen - Atrial Fib


Interpret:
// A fib {
    Ventricular response: Tachy or brady? (ex. Bradycardic ventricular response)

SVT: Supraventricular Tachycardia
    This is an umbrella term
    Not sinus, so there is a problem in the p wave
